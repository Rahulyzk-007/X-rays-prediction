# X-rays-prediction
This is a Deep Learning model of advanced X-rays prediction
using convolutional neural networks with an accuracy over 90%.
The CNN model has been integrated with VGG16 architecture,ResNet architecture and Custom CNN
helping the model to predict whether a certain X-ray of a 
human is deceased nor not.
The dataset has been compiled from disparate sources from online sites and also from KAGGLE.
The model has been encompassed from Brain Cancer,Chest Pneumonia,Knee Osteoarthritis and Hand Fracture Datsets
and a Custom Organ classification Model which first predicts what body part is the X-Ray provided,Later Individually classificifying 
the respective X-ray of body part.
The model has been built simple and perceivable.
