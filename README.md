# X-rays-prediction
This is an Machine learning model of advanced X-rays detection model 
using convolutional neural networks with an accuracy over 90%.
The CNN model has been integrated with VGG16 architecture,
helping the model to predict where a certain X-ray of a 
human is deceased nor not.
The dataset has been compiled from disparate sources from online sites and also from KAGGLE.
The model can be used to predict both whether the given X-ray has been deceased by CHEST pneumonia
and also BRAIN tumour.
The model built is simple and can be easily understood.
